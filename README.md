# Selection History Navigator
(forked from https://github.com/mminer/selection-history-navigator)

This is a Unity editor extension that adds web browser-style **Back** and
**Forward** items to the *Edit > Selection* menu. These allow you to quickly
re-select the game object or asset that you previously had selected.

## Installing

Add the package to your project via
[UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) using the Git URL
https://github.com/mminer/selection-history-navigator.git. You can also clone
the repository and point UPM to your local copy.


## Using (fork updates usage for vscode keybindings)

<kbd>-</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> (Windows) to return to the
previous selection.

After navigating backward, you can also navigate forward with
<kbd>command-shift</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>ctrl-shift</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd>
